            <h2>I never had 100, 50 or even 20 pounds to lose. <u>But I wanted to live more.</u></h2> 
            <p>Hey there, I'm Sujal, a Certified Sports Nutrition Specialist, and a Wellness Coach.</p>
            <p>I never had any dramatic transformation as you see on the internet.</p>
            <p>My transformation journey is different, yet very common.</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 110px;">When we moved to the U.S. in 2015, I experienced an unexpected shift in priorities.</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>    
            <p style="margin-top: 5%;">As a wife and mother of two young kids, I found myself consumed with caring for my children, inadvertently neglecting my own health and nutrition.</p>
            <p>Unbeknownst to me, snacking at odd hours gradually replaced proper meals, leaving me feeling drained and energy less.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><b>It was a turning point that sparked my deep desire for change in my lifestyle.</b></p>
            <p>Despite of being not overweight ( in my head I felt it, but all my friends always found me lean ,haha) I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes, and had elevated LDL cholesterol and thyroid just at the age 32 with emotional eating disorder.</p>
            <p>Having pursued a degree in architecture and practiced in Pune, India, my transition into the world of nutrition seemed unlikely and unpredictable.</p>
            <p>However, my personal struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle led me have the determination to explore the realm of sports nutrition.</p>

            <h2>Strength is never a weakness !</h2>
            <p>I am glad I found my passion with my sport, powerlifting. Powerlifting has given me a new life :) </p>
            <p>I currently have a few dozen gold medals and a hold a state record in deadlift and squats in my division and hope to continue growing my passion!</p>

            <p style="padding-top: 30px">Determined to bridge the gap between indulgence and well-being, I embarked on a journey of self-education, obtaining multiple certifications and immersing myself in the study of nutrition.</p>

            <h2>My mission is to help people transform their lives for the better, to help them turn “impossible” into reality.</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">I strongly believe in empowering and building a stronger community to fight the obesity crisis in the world through vegetarian / plant based lifestyle.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 70px;">I believe, ‘building habit is a foundation to long-lasting success but becoming strong inside out is the foundation to building healthy lifestyle.</p>

                <h2 id="title4">Why Am I Sharing My Story With You?</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 80px;">I want you to know that just because you are struggling, and feel like you’ve tried everything, it doesn’t mean you are broken and beyond repair! I had tried it all: clean eating, gluten-free, GM diet, sugar-free, low-carb, Keto, the cabbage soup diet ! </p>

                <h2 id="title5">What I've Learned</h2>
                <p>Every failure brought me closer to success and the realization that:</p>
                <li style="margin-top: 55px;">Diets may get you to a certain point, but it’s habits that will keep you there.</li>
                <li>If you have High blood sugar or cholesterol , weight loss is more complicated than calories in and calories out.</li>
                <li>Healthy eating doesn’t have to mean organic and exotic, expensive foods.</li>
                <li>Everyone has an inner athlete – you just need to find the right activity.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 90px;">Staying lean and fit on a vegetarian diet isn't hard.</li>
